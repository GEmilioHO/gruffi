gruffi v1.2.4
### Major code base update, bug fixes and new features

1. Some dependencies when updating my packages (was needed for consistency)
2. Pull requests are addressed
3. Removed functions that were not used (still left some)
4. Code restructuring / organization
5. Some code annotation added 
6. Code much less verbose now
7. Misleading variables names fixed
8. New functions for visualization of intermediate steps
9. New helper functions

Results should be consistent with that before.
